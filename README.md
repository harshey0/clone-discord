<h1>Harshit's Discord Clone</h1>

**Introduction**

Welcome to the Discord HTML/CSS Clone! This project is a static clone of the Discord messaging application, created using HTML and CSS. While it doesn't have the full functionality of the original Discord app, it replicates the visual appearance and layout to provide a familiar user experience.

**Features**

1. **Replica Design**: The clone closely resembles the visual design of the Discord app, including the layout of chat channels, user profiles, message bubbles, and server navigation.

2. **Responsive Layout**: The clone is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across desktop and mobile devices.

3. **Customizable Styling**: The CSS is structured to allow for easy customization of colors, fonts, and other visual elements to match your preferences or branding.
